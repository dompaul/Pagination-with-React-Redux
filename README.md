# Pagination-with-React-Redux

This is a create React application that queries a paginated endpoint and uses Redux to save the results and then print out the results as a list on the page

### Requirements:

- The app should be paginated with the pagination reflected in the url (so when the page is refreshed, the same results are shown).
- Use unit tests
- Include a loading state
- Gracefully handle errors
- Have a search field that upon request populates the filters param in the endpoint

### Running the application
Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 10 on your local development machine 

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install
$ yarn start
```
Run the app
```sh
$ yarn start
```
or
```sh
$ npm start
```
